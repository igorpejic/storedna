			<h2> 7 Principles of ActionBoard Design:</h2>

			<div className="article__list">
				<ol className="pt-4">
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with the mind in mind.</h3>
						<p>Cater to the user’s mindset. Think of core decisions the user has to make, cater to the user role. Write intelligently, find the way how to cross connect different functions. Design different experiences for different roles.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Clarity.</h3>
						<p>Every visual cue has to be clear and color coded with StoreDNA palette. Messaging has to be clear and convey the high fidelity information within the smallest possible footprint. Build world-class help-desk and knowledge thesaurus.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Consistency.</h3>
						<p>Unite marketing material with the product. Use the thesaurus and be consistent. Name modules in the same manner.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Contrast.</h3>
						<p>Use contrast to illuminate key decisions. In Benchmark stores, use before and after in the more contrasting way.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Growth at the core.</h3>
						<p>Nudge users to drive growth of their companies, by using a social proof feed. Remind every user of growth in all communications. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Integrity.</h3>
						<p>At the core of what we do, we need to enable high level of precision when it comes to behavioral tracking sensors. Always upgrrade internal processes to check data integrity. </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<h3 className="p-0 mb-2">Design with Modesty.</h3>
						<p>
							ActionBoard should have the least amount of pixels which are able to convey
							the core message to the user. Should have the least amount of steps to act,
							enabling users to go from diagnostics to actions in fewer steps, making it more
							intuitive and easier to use.
						</p>
					</li>
