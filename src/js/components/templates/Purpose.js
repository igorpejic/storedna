	  <h1>Purpose</h1>

	  <h2>Mission / why do we exist</h2>

	  <p>We exist to empower retailers to make more intelligent decisions resulting in better consumer satisfaction and conversion. We are growth addicts using our systems to inspire and lead the way for growth-conscious businesses. </p>

	  <h2>Vision / desired end state</h2>

	  <p>Humans make decisions based upon gut feeling and emotions. In some cases this creates excellence and prosperity. However, in many cases it fails due to cognitive biases in reasoning. We are creating a totally new level of thinking which will not replace but enhance human decision making by using real-time information converted in easy to use insights. </p>

	  <p>StoreDNA strives to become world’s leader in driving informed and intelligent decisions in retail by using our AI agent who will empower and enhance retailer’s reasoning resulting in creating more efficient stores and seamless end-consumer experience. </p>

	  <h2>Purpose / values, culture and inspiration</h2>

	  <p>We, humans, live in spaces. When we started StoreDNA we found people were over-obsessed with analyzing online behavior. Think about how much time and money is spent on perfecting every click, every mouse hover, every multi-touch on your phone — but do we live in our cell phones?</p>

	  <p>We, humans, live in two worlds, two spaces. First, there is the outer world of how things look like, everything envisioned by our eyes. But hidden from this view is an entirely different second world: the world of how. How different parts work together as the whole. It's a world we cannot perceive at first sight. This second world is harder to understand. It’s a world that can only be understood by how our brain perceives reality. This reality, which goes beyond how we see things, contains an answer to how things move and change. The division between “how/science” and “what/art” is integral to understanding every aspect of human life.</p>

	  <p>At StoreDNA we are working hard to decode this world of how spaces and services actually influence human behavior. How can we shave of waiting times in queues? What if we could even remove queues altogether? How can we improve flow so that we can maneuver spaces as our ancestors walked in forests? How can we create spaces and services that enhance our thinking? </p>

	  <p>Spaces that inspire — think human-friendly kindergartens, hospitals, working spaces. Even cities. Human- friendly citizenship. </p>
