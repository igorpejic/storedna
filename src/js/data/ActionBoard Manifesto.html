<h1>ActionBoard Manifesto</h1>

<p>This document outlines mission critical product vision details to be used as the core document to drive product development. ActionBoard is the most important part of StoreDNA organism, and Monolith’s future vision of supplementing all human decision making related to spacial intelligence. In order to succeed, all StoreDNA’s proprietors have to invest time, energy, and intelligence in ActionBoard’s improvements. </p>

<p>ActionBoard - complete product along with computer vision algorithms, data ingestion algorithms, front-end user interface and state of the art help-desk system.</p>

<h2>7 Principles of ActionBoard Design</h2>

<p>At StoreDNA, we design systems which encourage growth. To achieve our mission we have to Design with:</p>

<h3>1. Design with the mind in mind.</h3>

<p>Cater to the user’s mindset. Think of core decisions user has to make, cater to user role. Write intelligently, find the way how to cross connect different functions. Design different experiences for different roles.</p>

<h3>2. Design with Clarity.</h3>

<p>Every visual cue has to be clear and color coded with StoreDNA palette. Messaging has to be clear and convey the high fidelity information within smallest possible footprint. Build world's class help-desk and knowledge thesaurus.</p>

<h3>3. Design with Consistence.</h3>

<p>Unite marketing material with the product. Write thesaurus and be consistent. Name modules in the same manner.</p>

<h3>4. Design with Contrast.</h3>

<p>Use contrast to illuminate key decisions. In Benchmark stores, use before and after in the more contrasting way.</p>

<h3>5. Design with Growth at the core.</h3>

<p>Nudge users to drive growth their companies, by using a social proof feed. Remind every user of growth in all communications. </p>

<h3>6. Design with Integrity.</h3>

<p>At the core of what we do, we need to enable high level of precision when it comes to behavioral tracking sensors. Always uprgrade internal processes to check data integrity. </p>

<h3>7. Design with Modesty.</h3>

<p>ActionBoard should have the least amount of pixels which are able to convey the core message to the user. Should have least amount of steps to act, enabling users to go from diagnostics to actions in less steps, making it more intuitive and easier to use.</p>
